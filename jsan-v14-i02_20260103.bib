ABSTRACT = {Human activity recognition (HAR) is the task of classifying sequences of data into defined movements. Taking advantage of deep learning (DL) methods, this research investigates and optimizes neural network architectures to effectively classify physical activities from smartphone accelerometer data. Unlike traditional machine learning (ML) methods employing manually crafted features, our approach employs automated feature learning with three deep learning architectures: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), CNN-based autoencoders, and Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM RNN). The contribution of this work is primarily in optimizing LSTM RNN to leverage the most out of temporal relationships between sensor data, significantly improving classification accuracy. Experimental outcomes for the WISDM dataset show that the proposed LSTM RNN model achieves 96.1% accuracy, outperforming CNN-based approaches and current ML-based methods. Compared to current works, our optimized frameworks achieve up to 6.4% higher classification performance, which means that they are more appropriate for real-time HAR.},
